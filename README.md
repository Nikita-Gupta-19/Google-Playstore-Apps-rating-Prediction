# 📱 Google Play Store App Analysis using Data Science

A comprehensive Data Science project analyzing apps from the Google Play Store using Python, Power BI, and statistical techniques. The goal was to extract insights regarding app ratings, categories, pricing, reviews, and installs, and to build meaningful visualizations for decision-making.

---

## 📌 Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on a cleaned Google Play Store dataset, identifying key trends across app categories, pricing models (Free vs Paid), popularity, and performance metrics.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** – Data Preprocessing & EDA
- **Google Colab** – Python Code
- **Power BI** – Data Visualization
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Statistical Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML Model For Predictive Insights
- **SHAP** – Model Interpretability 

---

## 📊 Visualizations Created

1. **Stacked Column Chart** – App count by Category vs Type (Free vs Paid)
2. **Bubble Chart** – Ratings vs Reviews (size: Install count, color: Category)
3. **Bar Chart** – Average Rating by App Category
4. **Slicers** – Category filter and Type filter (for Power BI interaction)

---

## 📁 Dataset

Cleaned dataset includes the following fields:
- `App`, `Category`, `Rating`, `Reviews`, `Installs`, `Price`, `Type`
- `App_Age`, `Genres`, `Size`, `Content Rating`, `Last Updated`
- Derived columns: `Category_Label`, `Is_Expensive`, etc.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Most apps on the Play Store are **Free**, with a few dominant **Paid categories** like Finance, Productivity, and House & Home.
- Categories such as **Family**, **Tools**, and **Productivity** host the majority of apps.
- A small number of apps dominate install counts and review volumes.
- Categories with high installs don't always correlate with the highest average ratings.

## 📊 Power BI Report

- Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
- Interact with slicers to filter by app type/category
- Explore dashboards created from cleaned Google Play Store data

---

## 🧠 Future Scope

- Build an ML model to predict app ratings using user metrics
- Deploy insights via a web dashboard (e.g., using **Streamlit**)
- Integrate NLP to analyze user reviews (sentiment analysis)

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

- **Dataset**: Cleaned version of Google Play Store dataset
- **Tools**: Google Colab, Power BI, Python
- **Inspiration**: Real-world business analytics scenarios
